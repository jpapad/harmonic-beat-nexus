# DJ Suite - Harmonic Mixing Tools

A professional DJ analysis and mixing suite with emphasis on harmonic mixing tools, similar to Mixed In Key. This is the **frontend React application** part of the full monorepo architecture.

## 🎵 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core UI Components
- **Dashboard**: Stats overview, recent projects, quick actions
- **Audio Analyzer**: File upload, waveform display, analysis results
- **Playlist Generator**: AI-powered harmonic playlist creation with filters
- **Set Builder**: Drag & drop interface with mixing suggestions
- **Track Library**: Searchable library with filtering capabilities
- **Camelot Wheel**: Interactive harmonic key visualization
- **Settings**: Theme customization and integrations

### ✅ Design System
- **Dark Professional Theme**: Optimized for studio environments
- **Semantic Color System**: DJ-specific color tokens (waveform, beatgrid, cues, energy levels)
- **Camelot Wheel Colors**: Distinct colors for major/minor keys
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Glass Morphism Effects**: Modern UI with backdrop blur
- **Smooth Animations**: Professional transitions and micro-interactions

### ✅ Mock Data & Interactions
- Simulated audio analysis with BPM, key detection, and energy levels
- Interactive Camelot wheel with key compatibility highlighting
- Playlist generation with harmonic mixing filters
- File upload with progress simulation
- Track library with sorting and filtering

## 🏗️ Architecture

This is built as a **React + Vite + TypeScript** frontend that's ready to connect to your planned **FastAPI backend**. The UI is designed to work with the API structure you outlined:

```typescript
// Expected API responses (already typed in components)
interface TrackAnalysis {
  id: string;
  duration_ms: number;
  bpm: number;
  bpm_confidence: number;
  key: {
    note: string;
    mode: 'major' | 'minor';
    camelot: string;
    confidence: number;
  };
  energy: {
    lufs: number;
    rms: number;
    score: number;
  };
  cues: Array<{label: string; time: number; bar: number}>;
  beatgrid: number[];
  waveform: number[];
}
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is ready to run in the current Lovable environment. The key sections you can explore:

1. **Dashboard** - Overview of your DJ workflow
2. **Analyzer** - Upload and analyze audio files
3. **Playlists** - Generate harmonic playlists
4. **Set Builder** - Build DJ sets with suggestions
5. **Library** - Browse your track collection
6. **Settings** - Customize theme and integrations

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Professional Studio Look**: Dark theme optimized for low-light environments
- **Harmonic Color Coding**: Different colors for major/minor keys, energy levels
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Camelot wheel, waveform displays, energy meters
- **Modern UX**: Smooth transitions, hover states, and micro-interactions
- **White-label Ready**: Easy theme customization in settings

## 🔄 Export to GitHub

This project is ready to be **exported to GitHub** where you can continue development with your full monorepo structure:

### Next Steps After GitHub Export:

1. **Set up the monorepo structure** as outlined in your original request
2. **Add the FastAPI backend** (`apps/api/`) with Python analyzers
3. **Add the RQ worker** (`apps/worker/`) for background processing
4. **Create shared packages** (`packages/shared/`) with TypeScript types
5. **Add environment configuration** (`.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`)
6. **Implement real audio analysis** using librosa, pyloudnorm, etc.
7. **Add Spotify OAuth integration** for playlist pushing
8. **Connect the frontend to real API endpoints**

### Recommended Development Flow:

1. Export to GitHub from Lovable
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Add the backend components following your monorepo structure
4. Start with stub/mock analyzers that return the expected JSON format
5. Gradually implement real audio analysis features
6. Add authentication and Spotify integration
7. Deploy with your preferred hosting solution

## 🎯 What's Next?

This frontend provides a solid foundation for your full DJ Suite. The next major milestones would be:

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to FastAPI endpoints
2. **Real Audio Processing**: Implement librosa-based analyzers
3. **User Authentication**: Add NextAuth.js or similar
4. **Spotify Integration**: OAuth flow and playlist management
5. **File Storage**: Add cloud storage for audio files
6. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket for analysis progress
7. **Advanced Mixing**: Implement the harmonic mixing engine
8. **Export Features**: CSV/M3U/JSON playlist exports

The UI is designed to handle all these features once the backend is implemented!
